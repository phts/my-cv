Written in LaTeX.
[Compiled to PDF](https://phts.github.io/my-cv/Phil%20Tsaryk%20-%20CV.pdf).

## Development

PDF compiler requires LaTeX engine to be installed.
I used [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/download) (on Windows) and
[texlive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) (on Debian):

    pdflatex my-cv.tex

Online LaTeX preview and PDF compiler is avalable on
[writelatex.com](https://www.writelatex.com).
